								<h2>My Life as a Windows User</h2>
								<p>
										My family had a desktop computer and I remember smashing keys on Microsoft Word. That's probably the first
										memory I can think of when thinking about technology. I don't think I could even spell anything at this point.
										I'd entertain myself by playing games like the pre-installed Minesweeper, which I still don't know how to play.
										I'd waste hours playing Pinball and trying to beat my own score. And I'd get my first exposure to digital art
										by trying to draw on MS Paint. I think this just normalized technology for me; I didn't realize some people had
										their first experience much later in life.

								<h2>Hello Kitty</h2>
								<p>
										At this point, I listened to what anyone told me irregardless of who it was. I saw commercials that told
										me to ask a parent before going online. I would ask my dad if I could go on <a href="http://hellokitty.com">hellokitty.com</a>,
										All I would ever do on this website is make wishlists of merchandise I wish I could have bought. At this point, I was connecting
										things I liked in reality (like Pokemon and TV channel's websites) and finding the sort of "enhancements" or extras to the things
										I already liked. I'd go and play flash games, but it wasn't massively multiplayer, it was just me.

								<h2>The Neopets Era</h2>
								<p>
										Like any other kid in my class, I enjoyed Neopets. I had my first exposure to HTML and CSS when trying to make my
										userlookup look really good, but I still had no idea what I was doing. I joined guilds and tried to raise in the ranks
										and try to be one of the higher levels and talk to others. It was probably one of my first times talking to strangers
										on the Internet (and trying to impress them?). I still spend too much time on this website.

								<h2>Making online friends</h2>
								<p>
										This is kind of a very generalized section, which encompasses a lot years that were really formative for me.
										I joined other sites, became a moderator, and was actually was a person of authority when I was in 6th grade.
										I was on websites like deviantART and had people interested in being my friend and making art with me. I
										played MMORPGs and made friends as we all made virtual money and powered up our virtual avatars. I made a lot of
										friends and it began to open the world to me. It was still a narrow view but wider than I think it could've ever
										been to me at that time.

								<h2>Descent</h2>
								<p>
										I joined Tumblr after an online friend showed it to me. All I ever did was look at bad memes. I think
										this was a descent of me going from a creative and productive person into someone more passive and
										only regenerating content from other sources. This is valid too, but it was definitely a shift for me
										as a user.

					<h1>The Role of Technology in my Future üëÄ</h1>
					<p id="big-text">
						I see technology playing a huge role in my life from this point forward. I‚Äôm planning on going into the tech industry and creating software and designing new products. They‚Äôve been a huge part of my life right now and I really hope to make an impact on the industry (no matter how small) myself. I think computers are going to be integrated into our lives from this point on, and we are making computers and machines help make our lives easier and better. It‚Äôs a fact of life, but the importance is balance rather than clinging onto a past that we can never go back to. Like many of the literature we‚Äôve read or videos we‚Äôve seen we are ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù the machine, it is human-centric and human centered. The data is created by humans, even if machines can generate it, it came from us.
						Below, I write some more of my thoughts on the future and technology at large.
					</p>
					<h3>Emulation/Enhancement of Reality (VR/AR)</h3>
					<p>
						I think VR has already become an extension to entertainment. I think this is funny because I remember watching a lot
						of TV where we imagined being able to fully immerse ourselves in things like video games. Typically, when we look back
						at what we think about for the future, we see that we imagined it all wrong. It‚Äôs funny to see how differently this
						happened with VR. In the future, I can already see VR Gaming Arcades. It‚Äôll be common to be able to have access to
						stockpiles of games, movies, second lives, if not already having access in their comfort of your own home.
					</p>
					<h3>Convenience to the Utmost Degree</h3>
					<p>
						We saw examples about how we saw that the machine is ‚Äúus.‚Äù And we truly are. We are creating machines to make life easier for us,
						to improve it overall, and make things more efficient. This extends itself to several instances of where we are trying to connect
						our physical identity to our ones online. This extends to both VR and the shared economy we're diving into, but I think before
						we realize it, we'll end up having these merged identities. The Internet of Things will know who we are, and integrate reality
						into what was previously inanimate objects that aren't "smart."
					</p>
					<h3>Shared Economy</h3>
					<p>
						This is the mixture of reality and the realm of the Internet. Where we used to previously say, don‚Äôt share your personal
						information on the Internet, now we openly get into people‚Äôs cars to get to destinations. This intermingling of personas
						(how we must portray ourselves online) and then the meeting brings together a new methodology to consider for how to communicate
						with others that isn‚Äôt quite professional and formal but not entirely casual either. It seems very contractual but where does
						the line draw? For some, it seems business, which may be the case. At least in my own experience, it becomes more personal.
						I hear stories rather than just service. It‚Äôs really changed the way we interact, unsure if for better or worse. It makes me
						wonder about how we‚Äôll transform ourselves in sharing things in the future. Perhaps we‚Äôll start lending libraries for
						necessities we discover we don‚Äôt always need to keep to ourselves. So far, it‚Äôs been more about ease when away from our
						own private spaces. Things like cars and homes. Where‚Äôs the line we really ever draw for going too far?
